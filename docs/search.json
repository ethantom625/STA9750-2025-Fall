As more media reaches India, there are more opportunities to benefit from the great spread of differing cultural arts and the consumption of local content. Many foreign shows and films are reaching into India’s top 10, ranging from WWE Smackdown to Squid Games. Though there is plenty of foreign media, there is also plenty of domestic media that remains in the top 10 such as, The Great Indian Kapil Show. There is much growth to be had as the expansion of foreign media looms greatly bringing the global top 10 into India’s perview."

    "text": "Netflix: Built on the Binge\nThe binge factor for streaming is one that cannot be ignored. As we explore the data, we find that there is a larger grasp that television has as it pertains to the streaming time. This makes sense when viewing from a pure content quantity but it definitely follows when we look at the duration that content sits in the top 10. If we look at what content has cumulatively been in the top 10 for more than 20 weeks, we find that it the category the content belongs to tends to be TV. Of the 59 piece of content that share this criteria, only 8 are film and 51 are TV shows. Netflix and streaming in general is overwhelmingly contingent on the ability to binge the content being presented and TV shows tend to be the primary guide to that as weekly stream hours are boosted by the needed to complete a show’s season over and over again."
